# Kmarket-to-DB-with-UI
A base project for importing data from kmarket to DB and showing the data with queries.
The 3included folder is a python script to scrape the data from api to a local database with the requirements inside whereas the commo folder is the one which has all
the html,css and php files which has a login/signup page and a basic homepage which shows a search bar to search the database via a date and show the results in a basic table.
Major thanks to Mr.Sushil Bhandari for guiding me when I needed ideas on what to do and helping out immensely when I didn't understand stuff either.
